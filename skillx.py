                "Job Description" (bold): Concise and informative (2-3 sentences) focusing on key responsibilities and required skills.
                "Average Annual Salary"(bold): If available, provide the average annual salary in US dollars in a uniform font size. If unavailable, state "Salary information unavailable."
                "Skill Match Analysis Summary" (bold): Provide an elaborate analysis describing how the job seeker's top skills and how they align with the recommended role. Classify their skills as a strong, partial, or weak match.
                "Skill Match Analysis Explained" (bold): Present the skill match analysis in a table for all of the top skills provided.
                        "Skill Description"(bold): Provide a description justifying why the provided skill is relevant to the recommended job.
                        "Match Strength" (bold): Classify each skill as either a Strong overall match/partial match/weak overall match based on the skill's relevance to the recommended role.
                            "Strong overall match"

                "Skill Development"(bold): Provide up to 5 specific recommendations in a bullet point format for developing any skills with a weak or medium match. 
                "Skill Gaps"(bold): Identify any critical or essential skills for the recommended role which are not provided in the job seeker's top skills: {top_skills_response0}. Provide suggestions to develop the skill gaps you identify.

            Divider: Insert a clear divider (e.g., "---") between each role recommendation.

        Limitations:

            Limit the response to 3 recommended roles.
